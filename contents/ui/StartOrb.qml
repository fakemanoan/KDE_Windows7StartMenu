/*
 * This is the Dialog that displays the Start menu orb when it sticks out
 * of the panel. In principle, it works in almost the same way as the
 * Start menu user icon, in fact most of the code is directly copied from
 * there.
 *
 * Compared to the popup avatar, this dialog window should NOT have any
 * visualParent set, as it causes inexplicable behavior where the orb
 * moves away during certain interactions. I have no idea why it does that.
 *
 * This has been developed only for the bottom/south oriented panel, and
 * other orientations should receive support when I begin giving pretty
 * much *everything* else support for other orientations.
